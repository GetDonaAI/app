# DONA AI

Because your brain isn't broken â€” your tools are.

This project explores building digital tools that actually work for ADHD minds. It's based on the understanding that traditional productivity approaches often fail because they don't account for how ADHD brains function.

Instead of gamification and fake dopamine hits, this focuses on accountability systems and habits that align with ADHD research and real-world experiences.
